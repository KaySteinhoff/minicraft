# Minicraft

This project was created as a training project for myself and as an educational tool for understanding x86 Assembly in combination with WIN32 and OpenGL.
This has no real use and isn't sponsored, endorsed or supported in any other way by Mojang, Microsoft or other companies relating or owning rights to Minecraft.

# How to use

To use it simply download the source code and run "compile.bat".
Minicraft was made using OpenGL 1.1 as it is the most easily usable OpenGL version as well as the WIN32 API to ensure backwards compatability for many Windows machines.

The resulting Minicraft.exe should be able to run on any modern Windows machine without issue.
